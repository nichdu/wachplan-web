    <h2>Thanks</h2>
    <p>
        My thanks go to Sebastian Lauber for his assistance in creating the wachplan icon and it's design. In addition I want to thank Tjark Koopmann for his assistance in creating the wachplan server part and finding nasty bugs in there. For historical reasons I'd like to thank Bj√∂rn Koopmann who helped me create the first web version of wachplan and it's design.<br/>
        The order of appearance in this section does not reflect any kind of ranking. I'm equally thankful to everyone of you!
    <h2>Libraries</h2>
        <p>
        Coding isn't a single person's task. So I used some third party libraries I would like (and have to) mention here:<ul>
            <li>GBToolbox, and GBVersionTracking by Luka Mirosevic</li>
            <!-- <li>GBVersionTracking by Luka Mirosevic</li> -->
            <li>JRSwizzle by Jonathan 'Wolf' Rentzsch</li>
            <li>RETableViewManager, REValidation, and REFormattedNumberField by Roman Efimov</li>
        </ul>
        Here, too, the order does not reflect any kind of ranking. I simply ordered the entries alphabetically
